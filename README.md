# Password Generator Starter Code
I was provided the starter code from the friendly-parakeet repository as the foundation for creating an application that generates a random password. 

# What The Password Generator Does
This password generator app runs in the browser, featuring HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code. It generates a password to meet certain criterias:
 
1) Have a length of at least 8 - 128 characters.
2) Confirm whether or not to include a lowercase, uppercase, numeric value, and/or special character.
2a) If yes, pull from the provided list of approved characters to add to the generated password, with at least one of each character type.
